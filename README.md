I have been working with startups since 2017, gaining experience across various industries, including real estate 🏠, charity 🎗️, fashion 👗, fintech 🏦, delivery 🚚, construction 🏗️, and currently healthcare 🏥.

I thrive on solving complex problems 🧩 and developing innovative solutions 💡. With a solid foundation in mathematics 📐 and physics ⚛️, I approach challenges analytically 🧠 and creatively 🎨.
